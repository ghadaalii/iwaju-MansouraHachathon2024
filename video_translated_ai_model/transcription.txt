 So what's the difference between a fast shutter speed and a slow shutter speed? Let me explain. Shutter speed doesn't just control how long light is allowed to pass through your lens and onto your camera sensor. It's also responsible for the appearance of motion in your images. So if you're looking to freeze time, then you're going to want a faster shutter speed. If you're looking to add motion to your image, then you're going to want a slower shutter speed and most likely a tripod. For more tips and tricks, don't forget...
